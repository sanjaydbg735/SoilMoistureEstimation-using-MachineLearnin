# SoilMoistureEstimation-using-MachineLearnin
we are estimating surface soil moisture(SSM) and subsurface soil moisture(SUSM) using machine learning model (LinearRegression, SVM, DecisionTree, RandomForest) and DeepLearning Model (LSTM).
in this project we download dataset of five Differenct city from Google Earth engine and estimate SSM and SUSM.# SoilMoistureEstimation-using-MachineLearnin
